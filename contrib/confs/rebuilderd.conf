## Configuration for http daemon
#[http]
## The address to bind to. This is 127.0.0.1:8484 by default.
#bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8484"
## If you use a reverse proxy, use this header instead of the actual connecting ip.
## Make sure the reverse proxy has filters in place to prevent spoofing issues.
#real_ip_header = "X-Real-IP"
## By default, the daemon attaches a new signature to existing attestations,
## if there is no signature by the current long-term private key yet.
## To turn this off, change this setting to `false` explicitly.
#transparently_sign_attestations = true
## Set a default endpoint for rebuildctl. This is especially useful for the sync timer.
#endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8484"

## A random cookie for administration is generated at startup and written to /var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie
## You can set this to a fixed value here. Use `pwgen -1s 32` to generate one.
## rebuildctl is searching for this cookie in ~/.config/rebuilderd.conf, /etc/rebuilderd.conf and
## /var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie in that order.
#[auth]
#cookie = "INSECURE"

## The auth cookie above is only used for the default endpoint.
## You can use different endpoints with `rebuildctl -H https://rebuilder.example.com status`,
## In that case you need to configure a section below if you want to attach a cookie.
#[endpoints."https://rebuilder.example.com"]
#cookie = "INSECURE"

## IMPORTANT: in production, make sure either `authorized_workers` or `signup_secret` is configured.
#[worker]
## If we have a fixed set of workers we can allow-list the keys here.
#authorized_workers = ["key1", "key2"]
## If we want to spawn new workers dynamically we can configure a sign up secret below.
## Use `pwgen -1s 32` to generate one.
#signup_secret = "INSECURE"

#[schedule]
## Configure the delay to automatically retry failed rebuilds in hours. The
## default is 24h, this base is multiplied with the number of rebuilds, so the
## first retry would happen after 24h, the second retry would happen 48h after the
## first retry and the third retry would happen 72h after the second retry. There
## is no upper limit of retries, if you can't afford frequent retries it's
## recommended to set this to a high value like 168 (1 week) or higher.
## Successful rebuilds are not retried.
#retry_delay_base = 24
